# CounterApp
A website that helps you count numbers between a range of 0 to 10 when you toggle between buttons. Along with a reset button to reset the whole count. when its 0 it should turn red and green when you count and yellow when it reached 10. numbers go up by 2 or go down by 2 only. I have used HTML, inline and external CSS, JS.
